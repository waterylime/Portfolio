                      <p class=info>I am (dont ask thats rude) old. I have lived in Georgetown, Colorado my entier life. I am
                          currently
                          in the never ending process of home repairs (YA home ownership).
                          I hope to retire or move to Tiipei, Taiwan. I have two dogs a mastiff named Deva and a cocker
                          spaniel
                          named Moco
                          they are both spolied rotten, and beyond needy.
                          Just to put it out there I am an introvert and an otaku, which explains my hobbies. In my free time
                          I
                          read, it
                          is not uncommon for me to have multiple books from multiple
                          series that I am currently reading going at once. I perfer to read Japanes light novels and manga
                          but I
                          also
                          like syfi. My current obsession with books has my
                          library at close to 10,000 books that includes both paper back, digital, and audio. When I am not
                          reading I am
                          watching anime, playing video games, cosplaying,
                          and any random art projects. My current art projects is working on several pieces of embroidery for
                          a
                          quilt I am
                          making. I can't tell you much if anything about
                          curent popular TV show, but if you are interested in politics I am the person to go to. MSNBC, BBC
                          News,
                          and
                          C-SPAN is what I binge. I enjoy taking walks, but I'm
                          allergic to the sun so it's a bit of a pain. When I have money that I am not saving to go on trip's
                          abroad I
                          love to go see comedins live, the opera, plays
                          (can't wait till I can get my paws on Hamilton tickets). Tho I live in Colorado i absolutely hate
                          snow.
